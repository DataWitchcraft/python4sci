This course would not be possible if other people would not enable high-quality teaching materials under free licenses. Namely, we would like to thank Jake VanderPlas for Whirlwind Tour Of Python and Tom McCoy for Introduction to Python notebooks, Software Carpentry volunteers for Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists, Python as a Second Language and Advanced numpy materials, Czech PyLadies for Datový kurz PyLadies and BioPython - for everything. See the full list below.

## Inspiration

* [Introduction to Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ghPQaTEdO9UH4s3gGD5OXmkYNvIwm2Zi?usp=sharing): a colab with the intro to Python, something like this we need for Day 1
* [Whirlwind Tour Of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython): notebooks for the Whirlwind Tour Of Python [book](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/python-notes/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python-2.pdf) by 
* [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/): Software Carpentry course tested on many interations
* [Python for Scientists](https://astrofrog.github.io/py4sci/): interesting 5-day course for some astronomy students
* [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python): self-learn 2-day course by Google
* [Intro to PyData](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/intro-to-pydata) - could be inspiration for our intro, Python is a [glue](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/the-unexpected-effectiveness-of-python-in-science?slide=34)
* [Python for Everybody](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/01-intro.html): good intro
* [Advanced numpy](https://paris-swc.github.io/advanced-numpy-lesson/index.html): SWC paris course 
* [Python as a Second Language](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-second-language/12-file-io/) SWC lecture, nice file processing summary
* [Datový kurz PyLadies](https://naucse.python.cz/2021/pydata-praha-jaro/) - Czech PyLadies' data course
* [BioPython tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) - just the first few chapters
